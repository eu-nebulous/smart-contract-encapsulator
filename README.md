# Smart Contract Encapsulator (SCE)
The SCE component is a component of the NebulOuS platform which encapsulates SLAs in smart contract which features expressivity of semantic models with immutability aspects that blockchain can support.
The main functionalities of SCE are:
- enabling the automatic transformation of SLAs into smart contract functions,
- infusing the SLA rules and the monitoring algorithms into smart contracts which are used to determine whether these rules are satisfied by application execution, and
- designing new interfaces and mechanisms for obtaining feedback from the monitoring algorithms and interacting with off-chain services and other third-party services.
